Image and Video Captioning Using CNN/Deep Learning Using Flickr'8k Dataset

**Image and Video Captioning Using CNN and Deep Learning (Flickr8k Dataset)**  

This project focuses on implementing image and video captioning systems using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and deep learning techniques. The Flickr8k dataset, containing 8,000 images paired with five human-written captions each, is used for training and evaluation. The project combines CNNs for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for generating descriptive captions. The model learns to map visual features to natural language, enabling automatic generation of contextually meaningful captions for images and video frames. Key applications include aiding visually impaired individuals, improving content categorization, and enhancing multimedia accessibility. The approach involves preprocessing the dataset, designing and training the model, evaluating its performance, and iterating to improve accuracy. This project demonstrates the synergy between computer vision and natural language processing.
